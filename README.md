# wallclock
Simple HTML/JS clock web page

I coded this for a Dell XPS 10 tablet I have hanging on my wall.
Unfortunately the browser options for Windows RT are shit, along
with the operating system, so it really never got used.

## Installation

Just drop the html file and jpg (or your own background named bg.jpg)
onto a web server.

## Usage

Point your modern (CSS3 compatible) browser to the page and hit that
full screen button for major clock action. w00t.
